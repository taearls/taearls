# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tyler (he/him). I'm a software engineer and musician based in Chicago, IL.

I work full-time for [Cquence](https://www.cquence.app), where I help create video software that empowers film makers and educators.

In my spare time outside of work, I love building Vue.js projects and learning new programming languages and concepts. Currently, I'm learning Rust, my first systems programming language, and plan to develop some fun side projects with it.

You can learn more about me and the coding projects I'm working on [here](https://www.tylerearls.com).

Outside of tech, I also play music and write songs in my band, Cuckoo and the Birds. You can learn more about us and listen to our music [here](https://www.cuckooandthebirds.com).
