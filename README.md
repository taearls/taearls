# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tyler (he/him). I'm a software engineer and musician based in Chicago, IL.

I work full-time for [Ensighten](https://www.ensighten.com), where I help develop web-oriented software that provides client-side security and compliance with current privacy laws, including CCPA and GDPR.

In my spare time outside of work, I love building Vue.js projects and learning new programming languages and concepts. Currently, I'm learning Rust, my first systems programming language, and plan to develop some fun side projects with it.

You can learn more about me and the coding projects I'm working on [here](https://www.tylerearls.com).

Outside of tech, I also play music and write songs in my band, Cuckoo and the Birds. You can learn more about us and listen to our music [here](https://www.cuckooandthebirds.com).

## Save Our Stages
As a musician and live music fan, I urge you to consider donating to [Save Our Stages](https://www.saveourstages.com) to, as their website says, "preserve and nurture the ecosystem of independent live music venues and promoters throughout the United States".

## GITHUB DROP YOUR CONTRACT WITH ICE
Seriously, what the hell. Children in cages, forced hysterectomies, families being separated, terrorizing people of color -- these are all solid reasons to drop your [https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-owned-github-defends-work-with-ice-employee-resigns-2019-11](contract with ICE).
