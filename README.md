# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tyler (he/him). I'm a software engineer and musician based in Chicago, IL.

I have worked in the tech industry since 2018 in fullstack roles. I'm proficient in React, Vue, CSS, Java, TypeScript, Node.js, and Rust. 

You can learn more about me and the side projects I'm developing at my [tech portfolio website](https://www.tylerearls.com).

Outside of tech, I also play music and write songs in my band, Cuckoo and the Birds. You can learn more about us and listen to our music [at our website](https://www.cuckooandthebirds.com).

Right now, I'm searching for a full-time engineering job that's fully remote. If you are hiring, please feel free to get in touch at [tyler.a.earls@gmail.com](mailto:tyler.a.earls@gmail.com).
