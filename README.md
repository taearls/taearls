# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tyler (they/them). I'm a software engineer and musician based in Chicago, IL.

I have worked in the tech industry since 2018 as a software engineer. I'm an autodidact with proficiency in React, Vue, CSS, Rust, Java, C#, and TypeScript. As a tech lead, I'm passionate about empowering my colleagues to contribute meaningfully and about celebrating their strengths and achievements. When I write code, I establish foundational patterns that widen the [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success).

I also actively contribute to open source projects. Recently, I've been particularly focusing on contributing to [oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project), a next-generation toolchain for JavaScript, written in Rust.

You can learn more about me and my technical background at my [website](https://www.tylerearls.com).

Outside of tech, I also play music and write songs in my band, Cuckoo and the Birds. You can learn more about us and listen to our music [at our website](https://www.cuckooandthebirds.com).
